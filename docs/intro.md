# Resources Overview

## Digital Identity 

As technology continues to evolve, the way digital identities are managed and stored is becoming increasingly important. The past few years have seen the rise of self-sovereign identity (SSI), a system of identity management that puts users in control of their digital identity and data. This system has the potential to revolutionize the way digital identity is handled, allowing users to easily and securely manage, share, and verify their identity data.

In the next five years, digital identity with self-sovereign favourability and privacy is likely to become more prevalent as the technology continues to mature. As more organizations and businesses adopt SSI, the process of verifying identity and managing data will become easier and more secure. The technology provides users with greater control over their data and identity, allowing them to choose what information is shared and with whom.

In addition to security and privacy, SSI also offers users convenience. For example, SSI can be used to quickly and securely verify identity and access services, such as banking or healthcare. This means that users no longer need to provide multiple forms of identification or share sensitive data with organizations in order to access services.

## Micro Transactions


The potential for blockchain based microtransactions is vast and could revolutionize the future of fintech, IoT, and other industries. Through the use of smart contracts, blockchain-based microtransactions could provide a secure, cost-effective, and transparent way to execute transactions. This could enable users to purchase and sell goods and services with smaller amounts of currency than previously available. Additionally, blockchain-based microtransactions could provide a more seamless and secure way to transfer money and assets across borders, without the need for third-party intermediaries. 

New opportunities for financial inclusion, as well as provide a secure, trustless way to connect different types of devices and to facilitate machine-to-machine interactions. Finally, with the rise of digital currencies, blockchain-based microtransactions could unlock new possibilities for digital asset management, payments, and trading.

## Triple Entry Accounting

Triple entry accounting is a concept based on the idea of recording all transactions in three different places – the sender, the receiver, and a third-party independent record keeper. This type of accounting system has the potential to revolutionize the financial sector, providing greater transparency and accountability while helping to reduce the risk of fraud and manipulation of financial records. This type of system could also be used to help create more accurate and comprehensive ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting, by allowing companies to track and report on their environmental and social impacts in a more efficient and accurate way.

The use of triple entry accounting could help to improve the accuracy and reliability of financial records, providing a more accurate picture of a company’s performance and helping to reduce fraud and manipulation of financial records. It could also help to create greater transparency and accountability, allowing investors and shareholders to better assess a company’s performance and make informed decisions and providing investors with a more accurate picture of thetheir investments.
