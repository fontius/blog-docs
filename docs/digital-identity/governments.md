As technology continues to [evolve](/docs/intro.md), the way digital identities are managed and stored is becoming increasingly important. The past few years have seen the rise of self-sovereign identity (SSI), a system of identity management that puts users in control of their digital identity and data. This system has the potential to revolutionize the way digital identity is handled, allowing users to easily and securely manage, share, and verify their identity data.

In the next five years, digital identity with self-sovereign favourability and privacy is likely to become more prevalent as the technology continues to mature. As more organizations and businesses adopt SSI, the process of verifying identity and managing data will become easier and more secure. The technology provides users with greater control over their data and identity, allowing them to choose what information is shared and with whom.

In addition to security and privacy, SSI also offers users convenience. For example, SSI can be used to quickly and securely verify identity and access services, such as banking or healthcare. This means that users no longer need to provide multiple forms of identification or share sensitive data with organizations in order to access services.
